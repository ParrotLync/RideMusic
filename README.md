# RideMusic

### What does it do?
I have always struggled when I wanted to play music in a specific train in a themepark server. This plugin adds your players to a show you can then play music to!
The name of the show is identical to the name of the train, and the players will only be added to the show if the train has the tag "RideMusic".

### How does it work?
- Install RideMusic on your server.
- Spawn a train
- Name the train & give it the tag "RideMusic"
- All done! Players will now be added to a show identical to the name of the train.
